                <p class="description">PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited 
                    for web development and can be embedded into HTML. <br/><br/>
                    Instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code 
                    that does "something" (<i>in this case, output "Hi, I'm a PHP script!"</i>). 
                    The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions 
                    <code>&lt;?php and ?&gt;</code> that allow you to jump into and out of "PHP mode." <br/><br/>
                </p>
                <h4>Example #1 An introductory example</h4>
                <div class="code-box">
                        <code>
                            &lt;?php <br/>
            echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!"; <br/>
        ?&gt;
                        </code>
                </div>
                <p class="description">
                        What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. You can even configure your web server to process all your HTML files with PHP, 
                    and then there's really no way that users can tell what you have up your sleeve. <br/><br/>

                    The best part about using PHP is that it is extremely simple for a newcomer, but offers many advanced features for a professional programmer. Don't be afraid to read the long list of PHP's features. You can jump in, in a short time, 
                    and start writing simple scripts in a few hours.
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                    There are three main areas where PHP scripts are used.</p> <br/><br/>
                    
                    <ul style="color:#232942;font-family:Fira Sans, Source Sans Pro, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
                    font-size:16px; margin-left: 30px;">
                        <li>
                            <em><b>Server-side scripting.</b></em> This is the most traditional and main target field for PHP. You need three things to make this work: the PHP parser (CGI or server module), a web server and a web browser. You need to run the web server, with a connected PHP installation. You can access the PHP program output with a web browser, viewing the PHP page through the server.
                            All these can run on your home machine if you are just experimenting with PHP programming.
                        </li> <br/>
                        <li>
                            <em><b>Command line scripting.</b></em> You can make a PHP script to run it without any server or browser. You only need the PHP parser to use it this way. This type of usage is ideal for scripts regularly executed using cron (on *nix or Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows).
                            These scripts can also be used for simple text processing tasks. 
                        </li> <br/>
                        <li>
                            <em><b>Writing desktop applications.</b></em> PHP is probably not the very best language to create a desktop application with a graphical user interface, but if you know PHP very well, and would like to use some advanced PHP features in your client-side applications you can also use PHP-GTK to write such programs. You also have the ability to write cross-platform applications this way. 
                            PHP-GTK is an extension to PHP, not available in the main distribution.
                        </li> <br/>
                    </ul>
                
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="General_Installation_Considerations">
                <header class="title_heading">General Installation Considerations</header>

                <p class="description">
                    For the first and most common form, you need three things: PHP itself, a web server and a web browser.
                     You probably already have a web browser, and depending on your operating system setup,
                      you may also have a web server (e.g. Apache on Linux and macOS; IIS on Windows).
                       You may also rent webspace at a company. This way, you don't need to set up anything on your own,
                     only write your PHP scripts, upload it to the server you rent,
                      and see the results in your browser.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    In case of setting up the server and PHP on your own, you have two choices for the method of connecting PHP to the server. For many servers PHP has a direct module interface (also called SAPI).
                     These servers include Apache, Microsoft Internet Information Server, Netscape and iPlanet servers.
                      If PHP has no module support for your web server, you can always use it as a CGI or FastCGI processor.
                       This means you set up your server to use the CGI executable of PHP to process all PHP file requests on the server.
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                    If you are also interested in using PHP for command line scripting (e.g. write scripts autogenerating some images for you offline,
                     or processing text files depending on some arguments you pass to them),
                      you always need the command line executable. 
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                    With PHP you can also write desktop GUI applications using the PHP-GTK extension. This is a completely different approach
                     than writing web pages, as you do not output any HTML, but manage windows and objects within them.

                             But if your file entirely contain 100 percent php code then you do not need the closing tag and
                              that is to make sure that no accidental  whitespace or new lines are added 
                              after the php closing tag which could mess up your website.</td>

                            So basically you do not need semicolon the Last line of php statement. 
                            This is useful when you are embedding php with html and it's just a single line in those cases 
                            you do not need the semicolon but if you have multiple lines though it's a good idea to stay consistent 
                            and just use the semicolon.</td>

                            We need to cd into our project directory which is htdocs program with project name and 
                            then you could run php files using the php command and that will give you the output. 
                            So you could basically execute your php code in command line if you want.<br/>

                            You could also use print to print something which essentially is the same thing as echo.</td>

                    ints can be specified in decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 16), octal (base 8) or binary (base 2) notation. The negation operator can be used to denote a negative int.<br/><br/>

                    To use octal notation, precede the number with a 0 (zero). As of PHP 8.1.0, octal notation can also be preceded with 0o or 0O. To use hexadecimal notation precede the number with 0x. To use binary notation precede the number with 0b.<br/><br/>

                    As of PHP 7.4.0, integer literals may contain underscores (_) between digits, for better readability of literals. These underscores are removed by PHP's scanner.

                <h3>Strings Syntax</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    A string is series of characters, where a character is the same as a byte. This means that PHP only supports a 256-character set, and hence does not offer native Unicode support.<br/>
                    <br/>A string literal can be specified in four different ways:<br/><br/>
                    <ul class ="list-style-class">
                        <li>single quoted</li>
                        <li>double quoted</li>
                        <li>heredoc syntax</li>
                        <li>nowdoc syntax</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h4>Single Quoted</h4>
                <p class="description">
                    The simplest way to specify a string is to enclose it in single quotes (the character ').<br/><br/>

                    To specify a literal single quote, escape it with a backslash (\). 
                    To specify a literal backslash, double it (\\). 
                    All other instances of backslash will be treated as a literal backslash: 
                    this means that the other escape sequences you might be used to, such as \r or \n, 
                    will be output literally as specified rather than having any special meaning.

                    Variables in PHP are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable. The variable name is case-sensitive.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Variable names follow the same rules as other labels in PHP. 
                    A valid variable name starts with a letter or underscore, 
                    followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. 
                    As a regular expression, it would be expressed thus: 
                    ^[a-zA-Z_\x80-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x80-\xff]*$

                    By default, variables are always assigned by value. That is to say, 
                    when you assign an expression to a variable, the entire value of the original expression is copied 
                    into the destination variable. This means, for instance, that after assigning one variable's value 
                    to another, changing one of those variables will have no effect on the other. 
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                    PHP also offers another way to assign values to variables: assign by reference. 
                    This means that the new variable simply references 
                    (in other words, "becomes an alias for" or "points to") the original variable. 
                    Changes to the new variable affect the original, and vice versa.
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                    To assign by reference, simply prepend an ampersand (&) to the beginning of the variable which is being assigned (the source variable). 
                    For instance, the following code snippet outputs <code>'My name is Bob'</code> twice:

                    It is not necessary to initialize variables in PHP however it is a very good practice. 
                    Uninitialized variables have a default value of their type depending on the context in which they are used - booleans default to false, integers and floats default to zero,
                     strings (e.g. used in echo) are set as an empty string and arrays become to an empty array.

                    A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. As the name suggests, that value cannot change during the execution of the script (except for magic constants, which aren't actually constants).
                     Constants are case-sensitive. By convention, constant identifiers are always uppercase.<br/><br/>

                     The name of a constant follows the same rules as any label in PHP. 
                     A valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, 
                     numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression, it would be expressed thusly: 
                     ^[a-zA-Z_\x80-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x80-\xff]*$ <br/><br/>

                    It is possible to define() constants with reserved or even invalid names, 
                    whose value can only be retrieved with the constant() function. 
                    However, doing so is not recommended.

                    All functions and classes in PHP have the global scope - they can be called outside a function 
                    even if they were defined inside and vice versa.<br/><br/>

                    PHP does not support function overloading, nor is it possible to undefine or 
                    redefine previously-declared functions.<br/><br/>
                    Both variable number of arguments and default arguments are supported in functions. <br/><br/>
                    It is possible to call recursive functions in PHP.

                <header class="title_heading">Class and Objects</header>

                <p class="description">
                    PHP includes a complete object model. Some of its features are: visibility, abstract and 
                    final classes and methods, additional magic methods, interfaces, and cloning.<br/><br/>

                    PHP treats objects in the same way as references or handles, meaning that each variable 
                    contains an object reference rather than a copy of the entire object.
                </p><br/>
                <h4>Class</h4> <br/>
                <p class="description">
                    Basic class definitions begin with the keyword class, followed by a class name, 
                    followed by a pair of curly braces which enclose the definitions of the properties 
                    and methods belonging to the class.<br/><br/>

                    The class name can be any valid label, provided it is not a PHP reserved word. 
                    A valid class name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, 
                    numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression, it would be expressed thus: 
                    ^[a-zA-Z_\x80-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x80-\xff]*$.<br/><br/>

                    A class may contain its own constants, variables (called "properties"), and functions 
                    (called "methods").
                </p><br/>
                <h4>Example #1 Simple Class definition</h4><br/><br/>
                <div class="code-box">
                    <code>
                        &lt;?php<br/>
                        class SimpleClass<br/>
                        {<br/>

                            public $var = 'a default value';<br/><br/>
                            <em class="message">// method declaration<br/></em>
                            
                            public function displayVar() {<br/>
                                echo $this->var;<br/>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>

                </div><br/>
                <p class="description">
                    The pseudo-variable <em class="message">$this</em> is available when a method is called from within an object context. 
                    <em class="message"> $this</em> is the value of the calling object.
                </p><br/>

                <h4>Object Interfaces</h4><br/>
                <p class="description">
                    Object interfaces allow you to create code which specifies which methods a class must implement, without having to define how these methods are implemented. Interfaces share a namespace with classes and traits, so they may not use the same name.

                    Interfaces are defined in the same way as a class, but with the interface keyword 
                    replacing the class keyword and without any of the methods having their contents defined.<br/><br/>

                    All methods declared in an interface must be public; this is the nature of an interface.<br/><br/>

                    In practice, interfaces serve two complementary purposes:<br/><br/>
                    <ul class="list-style-class" style="list-style:disc; font-weight: normal;">
                        <li>To allow developers to create objects of different classes that may be used interchangeably because they implement the same interface or interfaces. A common example is multiple database access services, multiple payment gateways, or different caching strategies. 
                            Different implementations may be swapped out without requiring any changes to 
                            the code that uses them.</li> <br/>

                        <li>To allow a function or method to accept and operate on a parameter that conforms 
                            to an interface, while not caring what else the object may do or how it is 
                            implemented. These interfaces are often named like Iterable, Cacheable, 
                            Renderable, or so on to describe the significance of the behavior.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Enumerations, or "Enums" allow a developer to define a custom type that is limited 
                    to one of a discrete number of possible values. That can be especially helpful when 
                    defining a domain model, as it enables "making invalid states unrepresentable." <br/><br/>

                    Enums appear in many languages with a variety of different features. In PHP, 
                    Enums are a special kind of object. The Enum itself is a class, and its possible cases 
                    are all single-instance objects of that class. That means Enum cases are valid objects 
                    and may be used anywhere an object may be used, including type checks.<br/><br/>

                    The most popular example of enumerations is the built-in boolean type, which is an 
                    enumerated type with legal values true and false. Enums allows developers to define 
                    their own arbitrarily robust enumerations.

                <p class="description">
                    Enums are similar to classes, and share the same namespaces as classes, interfaces, and 
                    traits. They are also autoloadable the same way. An Enum defines a new type, which has 
                    a fixed, limited number of possible legal values.

                    This declaration creates a new enumerated type named Suit, which has four and only four legal values: <br/>

                    Variables may be assigned to one of those legal values. A function may be type checked against 
                    an enumerated type, in which case only values of that type may be passed.<br/><br/>

                    An Enumeration may have zero or more case definitions, with no maximum. 
                    A zero-case enum is syntactically valid, if rather useless.

                <p class="description">
                    PHP reports errors in response to a number of internal error conditions. 
                    These may be used to signal a number of different conditions, and can be displayed 
                    and/or logged as required.<br/><br/>

                    Every error that PHP generates includes a type. A list of these error types is available, 
                    along with a short description of their behaviour and how they can be caused.
                </p><br/>
                <h4>How to handle errors with PHP?</h4><br/>
                <p class="description">
                    If no error handler is set, then PHP will handle any errors that occur according to its 
                    configuration. Which errors are reported and which are ignored is controlled by the 
                    <a class="linked" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-reporting">error_reporting</a> 
                    php.ini directive, or at runtime by calling <a class="linked" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-reporting">error_reporting()</a>. 
                    It is strongly recommended that the configuration directive be set, however, 
                    as some errors can occur before execution of your script begins.<br/><br/>

                    In a development environment, you should always set <a class="linked" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-reporting">error_reporting</a> 
                    to <b>E_ALL</b>, as you need to be aware of and fix the issues raised by PHP. In production, you may wish 
                    to set this to a less verbose level such as <i>E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_DEPRECATED</i>, but in many cases 
                    <b>E_ALL</b> is also appropriate, as it may provide early warning of potential issues.<br/><br/>

                    What PHP does with these errors depends on two further php.ini directives. 
                    <a class="linked" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.display-errors">display_errors</a> controls whether the error is shown as part of the script's output. 
                    This should always be disabled in a production environment, as it can include confidential 
                    information such as database passwords, but is often useful to enable in development, as it ensures 
                    immediate reporting of issues.<br/><br/>

                    In addition to displaying errors, PHP can log errors when the <a class="linked" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.log-errors">log_errors</a> directive is 
                    enabled. This will log any errors to the file or syslog defined by <a class="linked" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-log">error_log</a>. 
                    This can be extremely useful in a production environment, as you can log errors that 
                    occur and then generate reports based on those errors.

            <section class="main-section" id="Exceptions">
                <header class="title_heading">Exceptions</header>
                <p class="description">
                    PHP has an exception model similar to that of other programming languages. An exception 
                    can be thrown, and caught ("catched") within PHP. Code may be surrounded in a <em class="message">try</em> block, 
                    to facilitate the catching of potential exceptions. Each <em class="message">try</em> must have at least one 
                    corresponding <em class="message">catch</em> or <em class="message">finally</em> block.<br/><br/>

                    If an exception is thrown and its current function scope has no <em class="message">catch</em> block, the exception 
                    will "bubble up" the call stack to the calling function until it finds a matching <em class="message">catch</em> 
                    block. All <em class="message">finally</em> blocks it encounters along the way will be executed. If the call stack 
                    is unwound all the way to the global scope without encountering a matching <em class="message">catch</em> block, 
                    the program will terminate with a fatal error unless a global exception handler has been 
                    set.<br/><br/>

                    The thrown object must be an instance of the Exception class or a subclass of Exception. 
                    Trying to <em class="message">throw</em> an object that is not will result in a PHP Fatal Error.<br/><br/>

                    As of PHP 8.0.0, the <em class="message">throw</em> keyword is an expression and may be used in any expression 
                    context. In prior versions it was a statement and was required to be on its own line.
                </p><br/>

                <h4>catch</h4> <br/>
                <p class="description">
                    A <em class="message">catch</em> block defines how to respond to a thrown exception. A <em class="message">catch</em> block defines one or 
                    more types of exception or error it can handle, and optionally a variable to which to 
                    assign the exception. (The variable was required prior to PHP 8.0.0.) The first <em class="message">catch</em> 
                    block a thrown exception or error encounters that matches the type of the thrown object 
                    will handle the object. <br/><br/>

                    Multiple <em class="message">catch</em> blocks can be used to catch different classes of exceptions. Normal 
                    execution (when no exception is thrown within the try block) will continue after that 
                    last <em class="message">catch</em> block defined in sequence. Exceptions can be thrown (or re-thrown) within a 
                    <em class="message">catch</em> block. If not, execution will continue after the <em class="message">catch</em> block that was triggered.<br/><br/>

                    When an exception is thrown, code following the statement will not be executed, and PHP will 
                    attempt to find the first matching <em class="message">catch</em> block. If an exception is not caught, a PHP Fatal 
                    Error will be issued with an "Uncaught Exception ..." message, unless a handler has been 
                    defined with <a class="linked" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.set-exception-handler.php">set_exception_handler()</a>.<br/><br/>

                    As of PHP 7.1.0, a <em class="message">catch</em> block may specify multiple exceptions using the pipe (|) character. 
                    This is useful for when different exceptions from different class hierarchies are handled 
                    the same.<br/><br/>

                    As of PHP 8.0.0, the variable name for a caught exception is optional. If not specified, 
                    the <em class="message">catch</em> block will still execute but will not have access to the thrown object.
                </p><br/>
                <h4>finally</h4> <br/>
                <p class="description">
                    A <em class="message">finally</em> block may also be specified after or instead of <em class="message">catch</em> blocks. 
                    Code within the <em class="message">finally</em> block will always be executed after the try and <em class="message">catch</em> blocks, 
                    regardless of whether an exception has been thrown, and before normal execution resumes.<br/><br/>

                    One notable interaction is between the <em class="message">finally</em> block and a return statement. 
                    If a return statement is encountered inside either the try or the <em class="message">catch</em> blocks, 
                    the <em class="message">finally</em> block will still be executed. Moreover, the return statement is evaluated 
                    when encountered, but the result will be returned after the <em class="message">finally</em> block is executed. 
                    Additionally, if the <em class="message">finally</em> block also contains a return statement, the value from the 
                    <em class="message">finally</em> block is returned.
                </p>
